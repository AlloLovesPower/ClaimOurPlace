My prescription may even be in right now in a distant pharmacy.  Unknown.  But there is no email nor message communication to 'my doctor', who forced 20mg when I stated from the start 40mg.
Since I can't otherwise communicate with them, now is my opportunity to type this.
First is that there is no excuse for someone whose role as a being is to care for the health of others to have blinders on, avoid learning about those they care for, be unreachable, and then have it be some ordeal convincing someone who doesn't know me of stuff just to get my meds correctly.  
<br>
(i typed something too caustic here so removed but keeping this here so what is happening is visible.  I am basically in mental pain when I wake up each day)
<br>
Because 20mg runs out halfway through the day, it is most noticeable the following morning, like now, when my brain, with uniquely high dopamine requirements from a frontal lobe injury at age 2 resulting in additional parrallel webs of neurons requiring this and other neurotransmitters as resources, is at it's most resourcelow point.  Because 20mg is exactly half, my mood and reliability swings wildly half on half off.  I have been trying to not do important things late, and not interact with humans until 30 minutes after taking my meds in the morning.
I really wish, for myself, everyone around me, and my environment, that I could just have a doctor that listens to me and prescribes the right dosage.
I am not going to feel shady nor bad nor that I'm doing anything taboo and verbally sway someone with that energy forced on me.  If a doctor prevents any nonverbal means of communication, it isn't moral for them to make arbitrary judgements for those they should be caring about.
<br>
In my mind, I still see the things I should say and do, but without medication I can't say or do them.  It is especially noticeable after being medicated a long time.  Without medication, I watch the ratio of what thoughts I am able to act on fall from near 80% during early day to noon on halfdosage20mg, to like 5% on 0mg in about a day.  I watch the paths I should take in conversations go by without being able to take them and watch relationships deteriorate while, in my mind, constantly seeing exactly what I should be doing.
<br>
When I am medicated, it is amazing to me to think I got almost entirely Ds and Fs from elementary and up, and, instead of adhd diagnosis, 'my parents' punished me for 10+ years straight.  They aren't 'my parents' any more and I will never interact with them again.  Even on halfdosage 20mg I would say I'm not reliable.  I am able to do more of what I think for some hours each day.  But, especially something social, big, and complex, like 'convincing a doctor who doesnt know me' of something, is basically impossible for me to do unless they force no other option... like now.
<br>
I NEED a doctor who prescribes the correct dosage.  Half dosage is like gambling.  I'm sure part of why my prescription status is unknown possibly in a distant pharmacy is because it is tons of steps to do these beauraucratic processes and, for me on 20mg, some ratio of the steps I think to do I cannot act on.
<br>
 There are all sorts of other things.  I have on maybe 7 occasions this month, had the breathing issue I have when unmedicated come on so strong during the late part of the day that I upped my dosage on my own to get through.  The breathing problem and needing to solve it is where I chose to put my foot down. As far as this misprescribed halfdosage and all the problems it causes, I'm done with it.  I at this point NEED a doctor to prescribe the correct dosage.  
 <br>
I have all sorts of cool things I've shown doctors in the past to be like 'look im unusual and cool so plz help', but healthcare should not be about social status in accord with the human monetary system's measures of success at all.  I wasn't a 'questionable adhd case' as a kid.  I was the only kid to sit at different lunchtables in different niches almost every day, with negligable ability to do anything asked of me (Ds, Fs, and dropping out the result) from kindergarten thru highschool.
I am not going to let a doctor forcibly misprescribing the wrong dosage against what I say for myself knowing myself to ruin my reality.
<br>
Thank you for listening.  It's important that I typed this so it can be shown to doctors. 
 I have some pillremains to now take today and will look in to distant pharmacy if it happens to be one of the thoughts I am able to act on at less than halfdosage.  Historically, every time I fall off my meds, I wander in to the wild, essentially go homeless, and takes years and wierd flukes to do the steps to get back on.
I thought it important to type this before taking this remaining microdose for the day.  The wild swinging of halfdosage is too problematic, prevents me from coherently, in a nice situation, just interacting with the doctor and getting it fixed, and it  needs to change NOW.
And it's the doctor, not me, that is forcibly misprescribing 20mg.  I have stated the correct number from the start.
  <br>
 every important thing i've done this month, such as communicating with barb correctly to move from one place to another
